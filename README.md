# Price elasticity Project ðŸ“ˆ

![](imgs/elastic.avif)

Price elasticity is a fundamental concept in economics that measures the sensitivity of the quantity demanded of a good or service in response to a change in its price. It helps to understand how consumers react to price changes and is a valuable tool for businesses and governments in making economic decisions. It is calculated by dividing the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the product by the percentage change in the price of the product.

This elasticity can be classified as elastic, inelastic and unitary price elasticity:
- Elastic: Elastic price elasticity is a measure that indicates that the demand for a product is very sensitive to changes in its price. It is calculated when the elasticity value is greater than 1. This means that consumers are very price sensitive and have many substitute products on the market. They can easily find similar products at lower prices, which encourages them to switch to these products instead of paying a higher price for the original product.
- Inelastic: Inelastic price elasticity is a measure that indicates that the demand for a product is not very sensitive to changes in its price. It is calculated when the elasticity value is less than 1. This means that consumers do not have many options for substitute products in the market or cannot easily find these products. They may be willing to pay a higher price for the original product, even if the price increases, because they don't have many alternatives available.
- Unitary: Unit price elasticity is a measure that indicates that the demand for a product is proportional to changes in its price. It is calculated when the elasticity value is exactly equal to 1. This means that consumers are moderately price sensitive and have few substitute product options in the market. They may be willing to switch to similar products if the original product's price increases significantly, but they won't switch to those products easily.

# 1.0 Project Idea

The idea of â€‹â€‹the project is to study the concept of price elasticity and, therefore, the deep relationship between demand and price of products. In addition, it seeks to predict how much it is acceptable to increase/decrease the value of products, impacting demand, to try to find out if we would be able to increase revenue.

The dataset can be found in the "data" folder.
